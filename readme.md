For this approach, I implemented the Sieve of Erasthotenes combined with wheel factorization to find the prime numbers up to 10^8 effectively. The task is split so that each thread calculates their fraction of the wheel, then uses this fraction and the primes up to the square root of 10^8 to sieve through all chunks. The sieve is ran through indices that are not multiples of 2, 3, and 5, to further enhance its performance. It uses a thread pool to avoid the resource intensive thread creation / destruction, using the BS::thread_pool library. The time complexity is O(n log log n), with a space complexity of O(n).
