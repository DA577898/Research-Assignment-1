For this approach, I implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find the prime numbers up to 10^8 effectively. The task is split through each number by breaking the prime array into 8 different parts (for 8 threads) and each thread sieves each chunk, then does the same for the next number. The sieve is ran only on odd numbers to improve efficiency, and uses a thread pool to avoid closing and opening threads using the BS::thread_pool library. The time complexity is O(n log log n), and the space complexity is O(n).
